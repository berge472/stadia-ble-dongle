stadia-ble-dongle
====================

This project contains the source code for firmware to convert a USB HID device to a BLE HID device. The main purpose is to allow wireless use of stadia controllers. 

The initial proof of concept will target the `TinyS3 ESP32-S3 development board <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09X259SDP>`_ , If that goes well, I will spin a custom PCB with a smaller (and hopefully more practical) form factor.
